On the contrary, from the title of the show itself - ‘Love Destiny’ - it makes it pretty clear that this show is primarily a romance show, which it fulfils to a tee.<br/><br/>It was very clever of this show to transport a budding archeologist back into ancient history because the show gives us a natural teacher in her. As she gradually meets one historical figure after another, we get wonderful internal monologues about the various characters’ positions and their impact on history. And when she gets all excited over ancient historical sites, we get lovely little expositions of the significance of those sites. And through her fish-out-of-water personality and conversations, we are seamlessly introduced to the culture and customs of the times, as well as their hilarious reactions to her modernisms. History becomes so much more accessible and digestible as we follow Kadesurang/Karakade through some of the definitive times in King Narai’s reign in history. It’s a brilliant piece of writing and a brilliant way of introducing a slice of Thai history to viewers without making it too heavy or boring.<br/><br/>One would think that with so much historical setting, background, characters and events, the romance would be short-changed to accommodate it all. Wrong! Very wrong! As a romance tale of hate-to-love, and of fated love, this show not only provides generous amounts of time to introduce our main leads and develop their relationship, it actually also spoils us with plenty of fan-service and squeal-worthy scenes. If you’re a romance-junkie like me, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much fixes you’ll get. <br/><br/>This show does many things well but one of the best things about it is the character and personality of our main leads, particularly our main female lead. <br/>Suddenly transported from the 21st-century into the 17th-century, she is very much a fish-out-of-water and it doesn’t help either that the body she inhabits is one which has a reputation of being a rather evil witch. Having to not only adjust to her new environment, but to also redeem Karakade’s reputation amongst the community, is a tall undertaking but Kadesurang rises to the occasion magnificently. To see her slowly but surely win person after person around to her side is a lesson in human gentleness, kindness, patience and poise which has personally inspired me to try and do the same. She is resilient, resourceful and empathic, and she takes every hit she receives in her stride but without losing a shred of her dignity or determination. She is beautiful and amazing.<br/>Our main male lead is very much a product of his status and his time but his evolution from him despising the woman he is affianced to, to learning to see her for who she is in her new personality, and then to be curious about her, and then to accept her (quirks and all), and then to love her - deeply love her - is both funny and very heart-warming. <br/>They also make a pretty compatible couple. They don’t dwell on their fights for long; they take pains to listen, understand and learn about each other; and they learn how to accommodate, give-and-take, and be flexible with one another. Theirs is no childish playground-bickering juvenile romance, nor is it those demanding, personality-clash, dramatic ones. It’s quite wonderfully mature and steadfast, but losing none of its charm or warmth. I love it!<br/><br/>Before I say a few words about our supporting cast (because they are deserving of their own little section), I would like to say that another good thing about this lakorn is its great absence of your typical thai lakorn tropes. <br/>No evil nangrais (aka second female leads)? Check. <br/>No love triangles? Check. <br/>No mad antagonist/ crazy villain? Check. <br/>No plot-filler? Check. <br/>No long-drawn-out misunderstandings? Check. <br/>No lack-of-communication angst? Check. <br/>No revenge plots? Check. <br/>No slap-kiss? Check. <br/>No cartoon/ cardboard characters? Check.<br/>No inconsistent or irrational character portrayals? Check. <br/>Wow, too good to be true? Yes. <br/>There is, however, one - ONE - lakorn cliche that does feature itself heavily in this show and I would be remiss in not pointing it out. It’s your ‘tripping-and-falling-into-arms-followed-by-long-stares’ trope. Not gonna lie, this one gets quite a bit of air-time but they’re all variations of the trope so it might be interesting to see just how much they can stretch it, lol. They do water it down to just ‘turning-and-staring’ as the show progresses, and perhaps it may be a matter of taste but I personally thought the show did okay in giving this particular trope quite a bit of spice through its variations.<br/><br/>Finally, a word about the supporting cast. SOLID is the word that comes to mind. This show’s supporting cast have added extra layers of life, depth and breadth to the show. They sparkle and shine in their own different capacities, and while some might be a little more intense and heavy in terms of presence and personality, the show also gives us little insights and glimpses into their thought-process which makes them all comes across believably real and human. The scintillating supporting cast is truly a massive plus.<br/><br/><br/>ACTING/ CAST<br/>POPE THANAWAT - as Thun Muen Suntorndewa/ Por Date. I’ve seen Pope before in the 'Suparburoot Juthathep' series as the 2nd brother and I knew he had it in him to give his character an aura of gentlemanly dignity and authority where needed. And I also knew he could act and pull out the emotions and the tears if required. He did not disappoint. Our main male lead did a great job in taking us through his emotional journey from start to finish, and if he has not won for himself new fans after this show, I would be very much surprised. His eyes and his smiles are his best assets here as they are beautifully expressive. <br/><br/>BELLA RANEE - as Kadesurang/ Mae Ying Karakade. I’ve always liked Bella from her 'Padiwaradda' and 'Khun Chai Puttipat' days, but she blew me away here with her incredibly versatile portrayal of Kadesurang/ Karakade. I think this show/ script is also great as it allows her to really expand her acting ability and show us just how versatile and capable she is as an actress. I am so glad that she took the script by the horns and threw herself into it with gusto. She really is the main character and the lynchpin to the entire show and she shone brilliantly all the way through. Wonderful performance.<br/><br/>Best of all, the chemistry between these two in this show is on fire! No words - It has to be seen to be believed and after you’re done curling your fingers and toes, squealing into your pillow and rolling all over the floor in romantic ecstasy, you’ll get up and want more. For a show that doesn’t have many skinship scenes, this is a masterclass on how to do restrained romance in dramas. Goodness. <br/><br/>The supporting casts of actors and actresses are all stellar. Standout performances for me were:- <br/>Nirut Sirichanya  as our dear old Khun Loong/ Ork Ya Hor Thibadi (Por Date’s dad) was absolutely lovable. <br/>The girls playing Karakade’s personal maids P’Pim and P’Yam killed every single one of their scenes - they are a dynamic duo and such an example of sisterhood girl-power.<br/>Ampha Phoosit  as Nang Prik, and Chamaiporn Jaturaput  as Khun Ying Jumpa (Por Date’s mom), were an unforgettable double-combo act.<br/>Punjan Kawin was charming as Khun Reung, and Chartchai Ngamsan  had that on-screen gravitas as Kosa Ban.<br/>Louis Scott added vulnerable dimensions to a power-hungry Constantine Phaulkon, while Got Jirayu stole all his scenes as a charismatic and hot-looking Luang Surasak.<br/>And the actor playing Joi? Adorable. <br/>Really, the supporting cast all outdid themselves here and I’m so glad this show’s hit-status has brought them into the limelight.<br/><br/><br/>MUSIC<br/>The OST for this show has apparently been outselling itself so it can't be bad. Holistically, taking into account everything from the soundtrack, the background music and the sound effects, I thought this show did very well in incorporating the various elements of it into the scenes. I particularly enjoyed the way they employed their sound effects - it definitely added pep and pop to the scenes!<br/><br/><br/>RE-WATCH VALUE<br/>This show has so many things going for it - sweeping romance, liberal sprinklings of humour, good introduction into Thailand’s ancient history, beautiful sets and costumes, a memorable set of cast of characters, and a storyline which doesn’t spin itself into unnecessary knots or is packed with fillers.<br/>One of the best light-hearted romance dramas I’ve seen to date. Definitely re-watchable.  <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-36479\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"36479\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"36479\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"36479\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

The next day, news broke out that the King is gravely ill, upon hearing the news CP Lee Chang decides to visit to see his father. Upon getting there, the Queen forbids him from seeing him and tells him that if he catches the flu who would be the nation's next King. He later sneaks into the chamber and discovered something gruesome; a shadow-like a beast follows by a foul stench and the smell of blood  that could not be described. The thin paper bamboo door suddenly slides open with the guards outside questioning him why he is there. He follows with that there is a beast in the chamber and proceeds to persuade everyone.  The head guard tells him there is no such thing and that it must be the tiredness.  CP heads on to see his father,  but again failed to meet as he was stopped by an official. CP tells about the sighting of the beast and to his amused the official replied back with  saying he's seen it too,  a son who pretends to be concern about his father but really he wants to see his father dead so he can guarantee his safety to the throne was the monster he has seen (referring to the prince). CP is escorted back and finds out that the last physician to see his father lives in Dongnae and so the journey to see the physician embarks. The next morning, all the official gets together to plot a scheme to kill the CP, and so he was going to be arrested for treason. Meanwhile at Jiyulheon, as the physician returns with the dead body of his assistant, those who was close to the boy was confused and lost about how he had died. Seo Bi, a woman who's also a physician returns from her daily findings of herbs to see all the sick patients happily eating. Confused as there is shortage on food and nothing to eat she rushes to the kitchen and sees this guy (honestly I can't remember his name or did he even have a name, can someone confirm with me cause I really can't remember/ gonna call him GUY1) Seo Bi asked him where he got the food from and he tells her that he hunted a deer. Pleased that everyone gets to eat meat, she was asked to refill another bowl of delicious meat soup and so she proceeds to do so to find out it wasn't a deer. The soup was made from a dead body. Shooketh, not shocked but shooketh, because I was shooketh too, she confronts GUY1 about it, meanwhile, the start of the epidemic starts to happen. CP and his trusted body guard arrives to see the place locked up from the inside and looking like a mess. They get inside and discover the bodies of the dead and sends them to the magistrate. When all hope was lost guys, GUY1 &amp; Seo Bi did not die, yes they did not die and is friggen alive. CP and body guard finds Seo Bi in the mountain looking for a herb that can cure the dead, she finds out that the body has been moved to the magistrate and tells them that the bodies are not dead. They were literally like girl what you on about, but she keeps insisting them that the body will start to rise at night. CP slowing believing her asked her if the creature has a foul stench and blood smells and she said yes, and with this, it proves the theory CP has. CP sends his bodyguard and seo bi to the magistrate to check out what's happening. Seo Bi and GUY1 starts explaining about what the bodies do but no one believed them and they both end up in the jail. As night fall, the bodies starts to become alive and the village becomes the walking dead. The epidemic starts to spread and at this point in time, everyone finds out about the CP. This is basically the story, the CP ends up helping the people and everyone ends up at this city call Sangju, there with the help of his former teacher and his people, they start to build forts and trenches and traps to kill the zombies. As this was unfolding Seo Bi discovers the herb that can cure the epidemic. Back to the traps, they waited all night and nothing showed up, relieved they killed off the fire and everyone was ready to go and rest...and then...as the CP looked into the distance, a disturbance in the wood had set off the bird and the ground was trembling and trees was literally shaking!!!!! Seo Bi hears something and turns around to see that there are the zombies standing behind them,- you can see it in the reflection of the water...BIGGEST FRIGGEN PLOT TWIST she realises that they do not rise during the night but to the temperature, yes temperature. THE END. Another plot twist, the Queen is not pregnant, repeat she is not pregnant.  &amp; now the wait for season 2. I literally watched this when I found out it was on netflix via IG and I literally stopped watching my current drama because I was that excited to see it. I can't even explain it lmao, but like each episodes had it's own feels like my siblings and I we were so into it that like we commentate the whole series cause we didn't want bad things to happen t the good people and we were rooting for the bads to get eaten by the zombies. haha. But check it out. <br/><br/>Acting/Cast:<br/>It was soooooo good, like props to everyone who has to run like that like yalls MVP of the year already. <br/><br/>Rewatch:<br/>I would definitely rewatch this and rewatch it when season 2 comes out. <br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Everyone has to watch it like its sooo good, like I could not find any fault with it. Like its amazing.

I've seen this drama three times, and I enjoy it every time. I could probably watch it again, today, if I had nothing better to do. Sometimes, I watch the first few episodes just for the fun of it. When I feeling down, or when I'm feeling alone. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "This drama is the perfect representation of what true love is, and how it should be portrayed. Yes, romcoms and comedies are good, and fun and exciting during that moment, but this type of love... it may be acted, but it still is a goal of mine to have love like that, because even I know love like that does exist, even if that one is not real. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "This drama really hit everything for me. I'll try to keep the fangirl inside of me down, and be logical and realistic without giving away spoilers or anything, but it really got everything. There were so many plot twists in this story, and a lot of them weren't very original, and yet... they worked. I mean, come on, popular boy rich boy and poor girl, cancer, memory loss, pregnancy... that's just the beginning. It's like, everything you've ever seen in a drama was thrown into this one, and it WORKED. I know, I can't believe it.<br/>\n",
       "I cry so many times when I watch this drama, it's definitely a tear-jerker. It's a beautiful story, one that will pull at your heart and you won't be able to stop thinking about it.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "The acting was phenomenal, I think it is very underrated. Vaness Wu gets a lot of harsh criticism for his 'over acting' but I don't think there was a lot of it. I really liked his 'over acting'. When he cried... oh. my. god. I really believed it. He actually looked like he was crying, and it actually looked painful. I don't know how to put it... he looked like how a guy WOULD cry. And Addy An, she get's a lot of harsh criticism for her under-acting. I agree that sometimes she looks expressionless, but I think it had more to do with the script. Not only that, but I wouldn't say she under acted. I could see it in her eyes, in her reactions, in everything she said. Her mannerisms and subtle expressions, that's what made her character. You need to pay attention to those, it isn't in her character to look so blatantly affected all the time. Mu Cheng gets all of my respect, even if shes fictional. To me, the acting was superb, and lets not forget little Xiao Le. God is that kid going to grow up to be a super star. His acting was absolutely perfect, especially for a child. He really pulled the story together throughout the last half. Some go as far as to say the story was only held together by him toward the end, but I wouldn't go that far. With or without him, I would have kept watching, but he is such a cute little guy. Someday he'd get so tired during shooting that his dad would have to be on site. Such a strong little boy. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "The romance and chemistry between the Mu Cheng and Guan Xi is tangible. I can literally almost taste it, I can feel it. It's so beautiful, it touches my heart. I know this sounds cheesy and cliche, but really, you won't find more pure love in a drama than in this. If I didn't know any better, I would assume Vaness Wu and Addy An are in love. The chemistry was just out of this world. Love really does win out in the end, that's what this drama taught me. I have to say I learned a lot from it.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Also, the people you hate in this show you'll grow to love. Along with character development in the main characters, the side characters really developed too. The side-plots in this show were interesting, too, and I found myself just as engaged in them as I was the main couple/family. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "The ending of this drama is my favorite. Not just the ending with MC and GX but with everyone. The ending of this drama is also one of the reasons this drama is #1 for me. There is closure, on everything. No loose plot ends, all side plots are tied up, no questions are left, not for me at least. Everything is happy, I'm actually content at the end. No worries, no complaints, just sadness that it's over. Very bitter-sweet.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "I won't lie and say that this is an easy drama to watch. There's going to be a lot of painful moments and heart-wrenching scenes, but the good in the drama sky rockets it to the top. Even when you hate someone you didn't think you were going to hate, you understand what's happening, and why their doing what their doing. The love never dies, and even in the toughest moments in the drama, they give you little moments to nibble on while you're waiting. It's a brilliant story, and I will forever enjoy it and remember it. The music alone is beautiful, I have a few songs saved and listen to them frequently, even now. In fact, this is random but I have my itunes on shuffle and ironically 'Next Stop, Happiness' just came on. How funny, must be a sign. (;<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "If you're looking for a refreshing, pure love story with superb acting, tangible chemistry, and every plot twist you can imagine, this is for you! I will recommend this to any person interested in dramas for the rest of my life, hah! Hope this helped people, sorry if I wasn't as rational and logical as I planned. As you can tell, I'm a fan. I have never watched a drama more than I have this. Three times through the whole thing, not counting the many times I've just watched an episode here and there that I liked.

       "Not in the negative sense of the word, just the opposite. Watching it feels like reading a novel from centuries past, with all the tragic, the heart-wrench, the twist, the suspense and the sweetness of the most classic romantic literature. A friend compared it to a novel by Judith McNaught, and I tend to agree with her.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "One of the things I appreciated the most about this drama is the speed with which the plot is set in motion and the pace established. By the end of episode 1, I was fatally hooked. This is not a show which promises the viewer something, only to drag unnecessary by the middle or loosing consistency and cohesion at some point. If you like the dishes you are presented with at first sight, you will love the whole meal to the end. And a truly romantic meal at that, full of passion and not the usual luke-warm, lovey-dovey chirping.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "The acting performances are outstanding as a whole. I have read many complaining about Vanness Wu's broken accent, but since I don't speak Mandarin I didn't notice anything amiss. On the contrary, I felt with his character a lot more than any other in the show, possibly because he has to outshine the delivering with intense facial expressions. Ady An's character can stretch one's patience at times, but this only adds to the actress's skill to make it so. And the chemistry is palpable.<br/>\n",
       "The child is a wonder, no addition needed.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "My only complain lies in the editing. This is a general problem I have with Taiwanese dramas: too frequent commercial cuts, filled with those brief reprises in which flashes of scenes to come are shown over and over. Once the viewer is forewarned, I guess it can be overlooked, although I personally find it terribly annoying. The music falls under the same curse: it's very good, but played too often and at times it overpowers the dialogues. If I hadn't liked this story so much, I would have gone insane.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Overall, this is a drama I'm ready to recommend to everyone in search of true romance. It's a timeless story, which does not rely on trend, or shiny, perfectly made-up actors and glamorous outfits. Does it have cliches? Yes it has, quite a few even, but they are well blended into a solid script and a plot which will never get truly old.  <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-771\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"771\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"771\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"771\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

The leading couple is that good. This series is amazing just to look at, even without the subs. It seems to be based on a game, so perhaps that’s why the story is so-so, but it didn’t bother me in the least.<br/><br/>Love is a Game<br/>It’s relaxing to watch that on-going, tiresome search for a partner in life turned into a Love Game. Imagine a modern day girl getting the chance to choose from all kinds of yummy men. Although I can’t understand why it always has to be the bullying boy, apart from the fact that the love-hate theme is still going strong in romcom series, I can easily get why people are falling for the male lead. <br/><br/>Actors<br/>Whether Simon Gong plays the BL interest in Advance Bravely or Prince Charming for this time traveling girl, he’s the same heartthrob…easy on the eye…not bothered by method acting whatsoever. I’m curious if he becomes a natural after he transfers to grown-up characters.<br/>I don’t know much about Greenly Zheng. She has a lovely voice, unlike the shrill actresses I have to endure sometimes .  I was pleasantly surprised by Yú Tiān Yì playing the rich boy Jiang Xuan Yu, I hope to see more of him in future series. The supporting cast did a good job as well.<br/><br/>The Story<br/>I’ve watched Jueshi Qianjin until episode 24, which is, hopefully, an open ending. So I’m eagerly waiting for a sequel, let’s say in modern times.<br/><br/>(Rap) Music and Dancing<br/>The look and feel of this series wasn’t that bad either. The soundtrack has some catchy tunes, but I’ve never watched such bad acts from an actress in dancing and rap music like in this series, making her indeed A Unique Lady. <br/><br/>Verdict<br/>What can I say? I just love razzie award winning productions. Give this series a try, you won’t regret it.<br/> <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-45465\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"45465\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"45465\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"45465\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

It was a comedy but it lacked a lot. The ending was stitched together like a bad rag doll. Yibo's character getting constantly beat up was hard to watch. It should have been renamed \"Where's My Notebook?\" There were a lot of plot holes that never got filled, like why did the teacher cooperate with the ultimate bad guy? Or how did the fat guy and Lexi end up with powers? The ending was very haphazard and random. For one of Yibo's first series, I'd say it was a good start and his acting was the only thing that I admired. I won't rewatch it but I look forward to seeing his future works.   <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-91653\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"91653\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"91653\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"91653\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

Aumtumn's Concerto does that and so much more, it deserves an outstanding ovation.<br/><br/>\n",
       "<br/><br/>\n",
       "It goes from being a typical drama in the first few chapters to something so much bigger than that afterwards. It is like an onion(Shrek, too much?), it has many layers and you only discover more the further you watch it.<br/><br/>\n",
       "<br/><br/>\n",
       "It is a love story, a family story, a story about forgiveness, a story about being true to yourself and your feelings, but it is also a story about treason, about the two sides of the story, that not everything is what it seems at first sight.<br/><br/>\n",
       "<br/><br/>\n",
       "The characters are really well written, each has a hidden depth that you see little by little. The drama pushes you to watch more for you to understand the story, it doesn't lays it out at simple sight like most dramas do.<br/><br/>\n",
       "<br/><br/>\n",
       "I saw this when it came out in 2009 and I remember being super impatient all week waiting for the next chapter to air. Since then I've watched it two times. I have the OST on my computer, and the MV of the theme song.<br/><br/>\n",
       "<br/><br/>\n",
       "Taiwanese dramas are always being underrated because of the acting, but anyone who watches this will be really impressed with it, and if I have to name my favorite actor, it definitely is the little boy, he's just so cute and adorable, yet mature.<br/><br/>\n",

       "If you are reading this is because either you havenÂ´t watched it and you aren't sure if it's worth your time, or you have already watched it and want to see if anyone feels the same way about this drama that you do.

And if you are in the second category, yes, I think like you, this is genius and it is one of my favourite dramas. If I had a flavor of the week of \"sucker for romance dramas\" this one would definitely would be in there.

Specifically this part of En of Love--Love Mechanics, I personally liked the #VeeMark. In my opinion, VeeMark visuals surpasses the TOSSARA, and there's a lot of emotions being poured by the character so i really commend the talent of War and Yin. The OST are sad, the opening song is sad, the ending song is sad, and Mark is sad :( I'm looking forward for more series that shall come to Mark and Yin. I hope this series becomes a success. I will recommend this.   <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-71391\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"71391\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"71391\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"71391\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

There are far more better works of Kingone Wang than this one. <br/><br/>****SPOILERS AHEAD****<br/> ****SPOILERS****<br/><br/>So, I decided to watch this because the story seemed interesting, but I really shouldn't have because now I'm mad at the stuff that they showed. I will be straight to the point.  I'm going to mention the two things that bothered me the most, and well for the rest of the drama the scene weren't as bad. <br/><br/>1. The characters seem to have no logic sense, specially both main characters. <br/>Zhan Cheng is blind, so obviously you are going to see in the drama different scenarios where he is faced with difficulties which if he had been sighted he could have resolved them, but let me tell you something, if you are blind or have lost the ability to use one of your five senses, the other four senses develop more to overcome the disability. In one specific frustrating scene, Zhan Cheng and Yu Xi are in a boat and well Yu Xi falls into the water thinking that Zhan Cheng fell in the water, to my shock Yu Xi has a leg cramp —like everyone that falls into the water in an Asian Drama, be it shallow or not— so she calls out his name and he answers back in desperation that she fell into the water and he can't do anything to save her. He has the greatest idea of along with her scream in the middle of the sea and the night, screaming for help! There was another person in the boat, but could hear all the howling because, well he had HEADPHONES ON!!<br/>Zhan Cheng decides that it is best to jump into the sea and save Yu Xi, but it all goes awry because HE IS BLIND!<br/><br/>My logical solution: Boy, that's your boat! Go inside the cabin and try to find the other dude in the boat. If not, well try to find the lifesaver floating ring that are almost always at the rails or side of the boat and COMMUNICATE not SCREAM and ask the other person where to throw it. <br/><br/>2. The ENDING IS NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL!<br/>Ok, so imagine your boyfriends decides to marry you while you're in coma because he really wants to take care of you? Awwww. NO!<br/>Let's understand why Zhan Cheng does this, okay? <br/>He lost his fiancee in a car accident, after being in coma for a while. So, now he has a relationship with this other girl that is his fiancee's sister, and fate decides to repeat itself, she falls into a coma after an accident also. So, here I'm thinking that he fears to loose Yu Xi, just like his fiancee. But, to him the most reasonable solution is to marry his girlfriend (WITHOUT HER CONSENT btw), just her mother's approval of the marriage, of which she mentions clearly: \"If Yu Xi were to know that I'm marrying her off without her consent she would kill me.\" <br/>HELLOOOOOO! Her mother even admits that is no good!!!!!<br/>Even so, they go on with the wedding in the hospital room, the do the whole ceremony and the even record it, THEY EVEN TAKE PICTURES/VIDEOS WITH HER!!!<br/>Fast-forwarding to when she wakes up from the coma, she wakes up in his house (which is now their house) and she sees the wedding video (if I can even call it that) and she CRIES! like CRIES so touched of what happened. Eventually Zhan Cheng wakes up to find Yu Xi outside in their backyard and she says \"so I'm now your wife?\" to what he responds \"yes, you are my wife\"!<br/>...<br/>...ummm<br/>... huh?<br/><br/>At this, all I am thinking is that this is NUTS!! THIS IS ILLEGAL!! He practically FORCED HIS WILL ON HER! She had no say in it whatsoever. There are movies and dramas about people in coma and loved ones waiting for them to wake up just to marry them, while they are BOTH aware of the situation. Something that the writer did not care about. The writer does not care about one deciding for oneself, more like others enforcing their will on you! NO! Not romantic at all!!!  <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-38092\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"38092\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"38092\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"38092\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

The only thing that was wrong with this version is Koo Hye Sun's acting. I loved her in Boys Before Flowers and liked her but this character or maybe her acting was just unbearable. her over the top expressions were a killer. I wasn't expecting much but I;ve seen the Japanese Version. I have also seen Jiro's acting and he was doing a good job in this. I gave up for the second time. This not even Jiro or the rest of the actors could save for me.

Given the budget, I think the production already did the best they could with what they had, and I was quite surprise that they managed to pull off this much out of the limited resources that they had. <br/><br/>There were lots of plot holes and the series was dubbed over in the original Chinese version to make up for the inconsistency, but some part of the story and dialogue were still very interesting. I especially liked the first few episodes, the following not so much, but still passable. My favourite character in the entire series was Afu. I think he got the best story line, and the actor really nailed it portraying his character.<br/><br/>To summarize, do not expect another \"Untamed\", but \"My Strange Friend\" is not so bad as a story.  <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-92017\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"92017\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"92017\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"92017\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",

If you're left unsatisfied after finishing dramas, thinking to yourself if only the writers made better choices, or if only the characters were better developed … then you should give this drama a try.  Everything about this drama is AMAZING; it has a mind-blowing screenplay with incredible characters, not to mention its great directing and cinematography. (the action in this drama is top-notch, and the war in the later episodes was impressive beyond imagination!)<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "At First glance, this might look like another revenge drama, but it is much more than that. The goal of the main characters is not to infect pain and suffering on the ones who have done them wrong, and it's not to simply right the wrongs, but to do so while making the ones who've committed the wrong realize the gravity of their actions. In a sense, this is the hardest route to take for correcting what has been wronged, people don’t want to be reminded of their dark past, and even more to accept their faults. Nevertheless, the reason why I love this drama so much is exactly this, the main characters, although they’ve literally been through hell, are not out there for revenge nor to make themselves feel better, but they’re trying to reveal the truth.  <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "The plot is complicated and very intelligently written. There are 54 episodes, but I have to say there is no dull moment. The story has many layers and builds up on its episodes, becoming more and more intense as the episodes go by; we watch the characters execute their plans and try to overcome all the foreseen and un-foreseen obstacles in the most magnificent way possible. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "In my opinion there are two main characters, Mei Chang Su and Prince Jing. <br/>\n",
       "Mei Chang Su is the most intelligent character that I’ve ever came across in a drama. For achieving his goals, he uses his knowledge to manipulate people to do exactly what he wants them to do, without them even realizing his involvement! Despite his ingenious and composed personality, he carries the deepest sadness inside him, and that is what gives him the greatest determination for concluding his goals.<br/>\n",
       "Prince Jing is the moral barometer of the story. He is bold and true to himself, he values his loved ones more than anything, and he’s willing to do anything to protect them. That said, he would never go against his moral code, he is a constant reminder for Mei Chang Su (and us the audience) that they should never be untrue to themselves. His bold and strong character attracts capable people to him enabling him to have true leadership characteristic. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "This duo is the best I’ve ever seen anywhere, their relationship is so endearing to watch and their personalities compliment each other so well. Just having them both on screen was enough to make me give up everything I was planning to do for the rest of the day and give my undivided attention to this drama.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Another thing that I really like about this drama is that the other characters are all intelligent as well, which makes us understand why they were in power to begin with and why they’ve been successful so far. This point makes watching the main character manipulate these smart and sneaky characters much more enjoyable <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "This drama is for the intelligent, for the ones who are willing to sit through long conversations and enjoy putting the pieces of the puzzle together, for the ones who understand that sometimes no matter the cost one has to fight for what is right.

Most importantly, I know how a single hand can reach into  that darkness and pull you to shore.<br/>\n",

       "For sake of argument, I am going to share something very  personal. In 2009 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This isn't a  condition that you catch like a cold, but rather one that manifests at  a certain age and snowballs until it's nearly impossible to function.  You can't prevent it through proper care, you can't always predict its  onset and you certainly can't run from it. Essentially, bipolar disorder  means I suffer from violent mood swings - severe bouts of depression and  self-destructive manic states. Most people are familiar with depression  on some level, but the idea of a manic state is foreign so I'll take a  moment to explain it. If depression is an extreme state of sadness or  hopelessness, you can think of mania as an extreme state of happiness.  It's generally characterized by impulsive (and often destructive)  decisions, lack of sleep and is almost always accompanied by the  physical feeling of euphoria (you can think of this as something similar  to the effects of several drugs like ecstasy.) This state is the most  dangerous and, for me personally, meant that I would blow through money  on drugs and alcohol, ostracize my friends and family because of an  uncontrollable temper and sail off into the sunset feeling invincible.  These impulses left my life in ruins. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "I crashed hard during my third semester of college and had to  withdraw. At my worst I was suicidal, faced with a crippling loneliness  that I had never felt before. You can think of it like standing knee- deep and staring into a dark pool of water. The only light is the  reflection of your own eyes and even those seem foreign to you. If you  shout you're greeted by a distorted echo that you recognize as your own,  but it's masked by an alien quality. In this sense, mental disorders  create two yous; the you that you're familiar with and the stranger you  can't recognize beyond a silhouette and the stain it leaves behind.  You're a prisoner in your own body and every single day you feel  yourself inching closer and closer to the water.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "If there is a single safe harbor in all of this, it's love. When  two souls dredge through the fire and connect, the bond can become  unbreakable. Empathy is the great uniter; shared pain is like cement.  Love will harden through pain. Two souls become pillars, lifting the  other out of the water and into the sky. This is what separates this  drama from the rest. This is why It's Okay, That's Love is a  masterpiece.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Mental health is not a topic that is addressed very often in  Korean dramas, and when it is it often comes across as comical. Mental  health balances between something people think of as self-imposed,  something you can shrug off if you try hard enough, and something to be  afraid of. Because of this, it's usually presented as one of the two  extremes: something too light, often existing as comic relief or a silly quirk meant to add flavor without substance, or as something too  heavy, existing as some ethereal force that twists the mind into  something less than human. It's Okay, That's Love is able to present  something serious and keep a lighthearted tone without being insulting. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "If you're looking at the melodrama tag and expecting something  that borders on makjang, this drama is not that. The feeling of  melancholy threads this drama together, but it does not weigh it down.  You won't find endless sobbing, misunderstandings or two-dimensional  characters. Instead, this drama showcases the marriage of two souls  through unconditional love and growth. Love is strongest when flaws can  fit together like a jig-saw puzzle, and the characters in this drama  compliment each other perfectly. It's important to emphasize that these  characters are flawed. Too often dramas shy away from characters with  real problems and instead settle on external conflict to move the story in its entirety. The characters in these dramas are perfect outside of the  experiences they undergo and the forces that act on them and it makes  them two-dimensional. This is not the case in this drama. Most of the  conflict is internal, but it's relatable and organic. Every single character is presented in a manner that allows you to love and empathize with them - it's a multi-layered story, the supporting cast is also very well-developed.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "In addition to a perfect atmosphere, this drama does something almost unheard of in a Korean drama. It presents a love story that is not about the chase, but rather endurance. Adult topics such as sex, intimacy and trust are at the forefront and allow the drama to paint a picture of actual couplehood instead of traditional guy-chase-girl or girl-chase-guy fare. You'll watch the couple grow not only as individuals, but as loving creatures. It doesn't stop at love, either, the concept of friendship as a refuge is just as strong. The entire cast grows over the course of the show, and if you're anything like me, you will grow along side them.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "I really can't gush enough about this drama. It's been a very long time since I watched something that resonated within me with such perfect harmony. The soundtrack captures the moods perfectly, the actors (from main to supporting) have realistic and beautiful chemistry. The melancholy is haunting, but it won't overwhelm you. I cried, I smiled, laughed and lived with this drama. I saw those two souls grow into a love so pristine that you honestly believe they cannot live without each other. The term soulmate can only apply when two people love each other unconditionally, and they both crossed the sea in a rowboat to reach it.  <p class=\"read-more\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"#\">Read More</a></p> <div class=\"review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t\"> <div class=\"review-vote review-helpful-13428\"><span class=\"text-muted\">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"13428\" data-label=\"Yes\"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful\" data-id=\"13428\" data-label=\"No\"><span>No</span></button> <button class=\"btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote\" data-id=\"13428\"><span>Cancel</span></button></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n",
